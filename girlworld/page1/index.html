            <!-- planning a website is so hard. i am thinking of all the different pages  
            and possibilities all the time, and can never quite seem to get where ive gotta go.
            too many big ideas, all vague and convoluted and built around feelings and "vibes" (for lack
            of a better word) bear with me as I attempt to conjure connections and embrace this 
            ebb and flow of love, ache, beauty, candor ... a real and honest and raw dive into
            femininity and girlhood (obscure) -->
            the world used to be mine ... running and <br> <br>shouting and dreaming in the backyard of my <br> <br>
            childhood home. hours spent grasping at what<br> <br>it meant to miss something i never had ...<br> <br> i still spend
            too much time thinking about <br> <br>it, about all the things i couldn't <br> <br>understand at 8 year old, except now the <br> <br>world does not belong to me ... i am<br> <br>
             restless yet, nowhere to run
            or shout,<br> <br>though every once in a while i take for<br> <br>myself a slice of world just big enough to<br> <br> dream ... i take up space in the shower,<br> <br>
            staring out the <a href="../window/index.html">window</a> at all of the lonely <br> <br>rooftops, i take up space on the edge of<br> <br> the bathtub in a towel as i wait for the <br> <br>fog on the mirror
            to clear, i take up <br> <br>space on the toilet pissing and shitting and <br> <br>remembering how it felt to walk outside to <br> <br>the whole wide world that belonged only to <br> <br>me
